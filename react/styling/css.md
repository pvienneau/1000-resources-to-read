#### Modular CSS with React

*A lot of thought was given to the challenges that arise from building complex applications, and this stack solves a lot of them beautifully. Yet, I still wasn’t sure how to make styling live up to React’s modularity and reusability.*

*Fortunately, there have been some very interesting developments in CSS-land recently, with a lot of patterns and tools emerging to make modular CSS a reality.*

> **TL;DR** Both CSS ([CSS-Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)) and Javascript ([CSS-in-JS](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js)) propose opposing implementations to a similar solution/result. As tools allowing you to better handle styling in Javascript evolve and improve, so will CSS standards and availability of pre/post-processors through Webpack. On paper, they offer similar functionality coverage, with both having better implementation ease in certain situations. However, CSS-Modules seem to allow for better styling since they more *easily* offer pseudo styles, such as media queries, pseudo elements and pseudo selectors.
