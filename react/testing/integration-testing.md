#### [Video - 1:00:31] Testing, the way it should be

*Testing is the essential bedrock of software, and we can all agree it a must-have. But when we talk about writing tests for the front-end, most developers immediately run into several challenges. Brian Mann will introduce a new JavaScript testing tool, Cypress.io, which solves the hardest challenges of testing modern, complex applications. You'll leave this talk re-energized and believe that testing can be a fun, enjoyable experience without the soul crushing pain it is today.*

> **TL;DR**: [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) attempts to solve all the developper pain points of End-to-end testing frameworks by making tests easy to write, quick to run and simple to debug. It also allows to take snapshots of the rendering, run on different browsers and control the viewport size. All you need.

> **TL;DR**: interesting take on automating testing in of React components in Storybook through Cypress. Especially with Crypress's generated artifcacts on test failure, this would be a great approach to cover cross-browser compatibility, rendering regression and overall component functionality.
