#### JavaScript Testing: Unit vs Functional vs Integration Tests

_Unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests are all types of automated tests which form essential cornerstones of continuous delivery, a development methodology that allows you to safely ship changes to production in days or hours rather than months or years._

**TL;DR**: The three main levels of testing are unit, integration and functional tests. Unit tests validate isolated modules or functions that have no side effects in order to quickly provide feedback to the developers. Integration tests assure that modules or components work well with each other and other dependencies, assuring that features are working as intended. Functional tests allow to test the overarching features of the application, in order to confirm that functionality is valid from the user's perspective.
