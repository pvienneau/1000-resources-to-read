## Functional Programming

> **TL;DR**: One concept to remember from this is that immutability is exploiting object's use of references to allow to minimize structure repeat between mutated data structures by referencing structures between objects that have not been modified. Although it speaks more to the usage of functional programming as a whole, it unfortunately doesn't go into depth about the functional programmning mindset.

#### Why Curry Helps

*A programmer’s pipe-dream is to write code, and be able to use it repeatedly with little effort. It’s expressive because you write in a way that expresses what is needed, and it’s reuse because.. well, you’re reusing. What more could you want?*

   > **TL;DR**: In these examples, currying is used to setup each operation with Ramda functions, and passing data through each sequentially through a Promise object. The same pattern can be used with a compose to stream the result of each operation through to the next. The advantage of this is that it allows you to either break complex data operations into smaller pieces or abstract it away into its own method, currying as you get more data.

#### Understanding Javascript Array Reduce in 1 Minute

*Everybody knows what looping over a collection is. But do you know what reducing a collection means?*

> **TL;DR** Reduce essentially iterates through your Array set, pushing along an accumulator value that you can set values to.

#### FunFunFunction

> **TL;DR**: A great channel that walks you through the various facets of functional programming, building on the fundamental principles to punch the boundaries on what you can achieve. Also has many videos on thoughts/opinions on what makes a programmer good, both from the perspective of an employer but also from the perspective of a fellow programmer.

#### [Video - 30:16] Hey Underscore, You're Doing It Wrong!

*Brian Lonsdorf has a love-hate relationship with Underscore.js. Yes, it offers a bunch of tools included in today's functional programming paradigm (like map, filter, reduce, take, drop, compose, etc.), but in Underscore the functions are sometimes verbose and unintuitive. It claims to be a functional programming language, but how true is that?*

> **TL;DR**: Some functional libraries such as **Underscore** and **lodash** do offer functions that are leveraged through functional programming, but fall short of truly embodying the patterns offered by functional programming. The examples are shown alongside **Ramda**, in order to demonstrate the power of such a library that fully implements functional programming.
